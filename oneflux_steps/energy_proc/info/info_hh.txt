This file includes halfhourly gapfilled LE and H, an estimation of the random uncertainty and the version of fluxes where a correction for the energy balance closure has been applied, including an estimate of the uncertainties in the corrected fluxes.

The corrected fluxes are obtained multiplying the original, gapfilled LE and H data by a correction factor (EBCcf: Energy Balance Closure correction factor) calculated starting from the halfhours where all the components needed to calculated the energy balance closure were available (Latent Heat, Sensible Heat, Net Radiation, Soil Heat Flux, with LE and H original or gapfilled with high quality). The EBCcf is calculated for each half hour as (NETRAD-G)/(H+LE). The EBCcf timeserie is filtered removing the values that are outside 1.5 times the interquartile range and used as basis to calculate the corrected H and LE fluxes.

The corrected fluxes calculation are obtained using three hierarchical methods:

Method 1: For each half hour a moving window of +/- 15 days is applied to select EBCcf of halfhours in the periods 22.00-2.30 and 10.00-14.30. The selection if these time windows is to avoid sunshine and sunset periods where changes in the heat storage in the ecosystem is large and for this reason the energy balance not closed using the available measurements. The selected EBCcf are then used to calculate corrected versions of the LE and H fluxes (one corrected fluxes version for each EBCcf factor included in the moving window) and 25, 50 and 75 percentiles of the corrected fluxes are extracted (LEcorr25, LEcorr, LEcorr75, Hcorr25, Hcorr, Hcorr75).

Method 2: applied in the halfhours where the moving window of method 1 includes less than 5 EBCcf values. The corrected fluxes are calculated using the average of the EBCcf used to calculate LEcorr and Hcorr in method 1 in the halfhours included in a moving window of +/- 5 days and +/- one hour. With method 2 LEcorr25, Hcorr25, LEcorr75 and Hcorr75 are not calculated.

Method 3: If it is still not possible to calculate an EBCcf (e.g. in case of long gaps) the same moving window is also applied to the same halfhour of the years before and after when available. With method 3 LEcorr25, Hcorr25, LEcorr75 and Hcorr75 are not calculated.


The random uncertainty in the measurements is estimated using two hierarchical methods: for half hours where original fluxes are available the random uncertainty is calculated (method 1) as the standard deviation of the fluxes measured in a moving window of +/- 7 days and +/- one hour with similar meteorological conditions (as for the MDS gapfilling: Ta +/- 2.5 Celsius, VPD +/- 5 hPa, SWin +/- 50 W m-2 if radiation is higher than 50 W m-2, +/-20 if lower). Random uncertainty for gapfilled halfhours or original halfhours where it has been impossible to find at least 5 measurements in the moving window with similar meteorological conditions, is estimated (method 2) as the median of the random uncertainty (calculated with method 1) of similar fluxes, where similar is defined as in the range of +/- 20% (but not less than 10 W m-2).
